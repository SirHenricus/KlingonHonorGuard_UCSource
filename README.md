# UnrealScript Source Code For Klingon Honor Guard (1998)

This is the UnrealScript source code for the game "Star Trek: The Next Generation: Klingon Honor Guard" (1998) developed by MicroProse. The game runs on Unreal Engine 1. I have exported the .uc files from the .u package files using UnrealEd (the game's built in editor that came with most Unreal Engine 1 based games).

Much like what I did with Nerf Arena Blast (another Unreal Engine 1 based game that I have extracted source code from), I only did this because I was curious about how the game works and not really for any other reason.

Nothing was modified after being exported. Though I may not have been entirely careful when organizing the files.

sidenote: Something I noticed about this particular UE1 game is that the models are stored in the package files in a really weird format that many of my tools can't seem to recognize. The only tool I had that even attempted to export them was UTPT (Unreal Tournament Package Tool) and when I tried to view the models using my Blender plugin, the plugin gives me an error. Really weird.
