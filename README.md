This is the UnrealScript source code for the game "Star Trek: The Next Generation: Klingon Honor Guard" (1998) developed by MicroProse. The game runs on Unreal Engine 1. I have exported the .uc files from the .u package files using UnrealEd (the game's built in editor that came with most Unreal Engine 1 based games).

Much like what I did with Nerf Arena Blast (another Unreal Engine 1 based game that I have extracted source code from), I only did this because I was curious about how the game works and not really for any other reason.

Nothing was modified after being exported. Though I may not have been entirely careful when organizing the files.
